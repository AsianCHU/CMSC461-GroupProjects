# **CMSC 461 SOAP Database Project**

The guidelines for this project is to develop a **System for Occupancy Agreement Processing (SOAP)** app using SQLite3 and Python.


## Database Setup

Create a new database named *project.db*, then execute the SQL commands in
*create.sql* to create the tables.

```shell
sqlite3 project.db

# Execute SQL from sqlite3 CLI
.read create.sql
```


## Python Application

The Python script allows the user to do the following functions:

* Insert a record into the tables
* Delete a record from the tables
* Select records from the tables

To run this project, gitbash, WSL, CMD, and Powershell all work with this; Run this command:
```
$ Python app.py
```
Which you will be greeted with a menu to select from.
